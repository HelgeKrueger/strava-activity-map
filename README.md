# strava-activity-map

Simple node.js application to display your Strava activity during some period on a map. In order to use it, you need to provide an access token for your Strava activity. This token is currently available at https://www.strava.com/settings/api/ under "Your access token".

The map is generated by first downloading the activities using the `get_activities.js` script into a `activities.js` file. `activities.js` contains a node.js module, which exports a list of encoded polylines which represent the activities.

One can change the tile server and thus the look of the map by editing the `tiles` variable in `app.js`.

## Installation

* Edit `get_activities.js` with the information on your Strava access token and the time period.
* Install required packages with
```
nvm install
```
* Fetch the Strava activities with
```
node get_activities.js
```
* Run the server with
```
npm start
```
* The map should be available at http://localhost:9966/
